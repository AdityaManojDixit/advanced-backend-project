Database Connection Ethics:
 Problems will occur while connecting or communicating with the database.
 Datatbase is always in another continent hence it takes time to communicate with database.
 
 To resolve such problems:
  - Always wrap in try/catch or handle error using promises through resolve and reject.

  - Always use async and await to communicate with database. As it takes time to establish connection.

  - Sample Code - 
            import express from "express";
            const app = express();

            //Eiffy: (async ()=>{})()

            async function connectDB() {
                try{
                await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URL}/${DB_NAME}`)
                    app.on("errr", (error)=>{
                        console.log("ERRR:", error)
                        throw error
                    })

                    app.listen(process.env.PORT, ()=>{
                        console.log(`Server is running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
                    })

                } catch(error) {
                    console.log("Error:", error)
                    throw error;
                }
            }
